# Algorithm Solution in Rust

Recently, I've been learning Rust. And I believe that the best way of learning a new language is to write the code.
So, I've decided to write the solutions to the problems in Rust. And I arrange the solutions into a rust standard library, add a test case for each algorithm. By this, I can get a better understanding of the workflow of developing a rust project and learn the Rust more efficiently.
